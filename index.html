    <h1>The Journey so Far</h1>
    <p>
      So far, I have learned far more than I anticipated. Beyond the basics of
      HTML and CSS frameworks, I have learned how Javascript, databases, and
      front-end & back-end connections function. Most importantly, I've learned
      that collaboration is an invaluable resource.
      <br />
      As far as accomplishments go, I’ve attempted to create and created
      applications that I’d never considered. I succeeded in my first group
      project/presentation in eight years. Using the terminal was very foreign
      to me before the coding boot camp, but it’s nearly second nature now.
      <br />
      When the program started, I was shy to ask for help. That is no longer an
      issue. I’m nearly a Google master now too. I’ve learned that application
      ideas need to be well planned, delegated, and executed in order to become
      developed. Above all, patience is needed to achieve coding goals.
    </p>
    <h1>Path to Success</h1>
    <p>
      For the remainder of the course, I’d like to deepen my understanding of
      all things Javascript and improve my development time. By the end of the
      course, I expect to be able to successfully deploy my applications and
      create a sustainable network with my classmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the course, I plan on sharpening all skills that I’ve learned over
      the past few months. I do not plan on rushing out to interview in the tech
      industry. A good place to start would be my GitHub repositories; I would
      like to go back through every repo created and updated the code until it’s
      fully functional.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the course, I planned on learning ANYTHING that would
      get me into the tech industry. Now that we’re beyond the halfway point, I
      accept that all skills require practice and I’ll need to pay my dues with
      the material we’ve covered before I can say that I’ve mastered it to job
      status strength. Everything we’re learning seems new and overwhelming. My
      new goal is to review and practiced what we’ve learned until I feel
      confident in my understandings.
